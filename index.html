			<p> Only an hour outside of New York City, Port Chester, NY is a village with a lot of movement. Majority of the town is Hispanic and working class. Downtown Port Chester is full of small businesses and many people from bordering towns come to eat, shop, and more. In the past 5 years, there has been many plans approved for apartment buildings and shopping centers that make it clear it is not for the people of the town. With rent and property taxes raising many have no choice but to leave the town they once thought of as home and a community.</p>
